## Installation

Clone the project.

There are 2 main folders:

* 'rest-api' for server - run on localhost:5000

* 'react-app' for frond-end - run on localhost:3000

You should add .env file in 'rest-api', just like .env.sample file, with your database credentials and some string for Jwt-secret.

After that in both main folders: 
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```
